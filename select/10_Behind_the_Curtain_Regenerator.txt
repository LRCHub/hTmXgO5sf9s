When I'm not walking with you
I feel the sun God
I'm in a desert of doom
I hope it rains soon

It's getting hotter down here
We've got no ozone
I know that this much is clear
Don't need no cell phone

And all the world's a wonder
What have we come to
Now I can hear the thunder
I taste a strange brew

Held in the fingers of malice
The tools of dark art
Hey come and live in my palace
Just hand me your heart

I know my destiny is what I choose to be
Nothing is certain behind the curtain
