you live your life
preying the sheep that
do as they're told
and stay in line
your hands stay clean
from the blood
that's shed by
your morbid empire
the wall of lies
you hide behind
won't last forever
show yourself
we know it's you
behind the curtain
pretending like you care
about everything
and everyone
when all
you think about is you
a hollow life
was all you gave
to the ones
who trusted your every lie
it's time to pay
for everything
you've done
you can run
but you can't fucking
hide
the wall of lies
you hide behind
won't last forever traitor
until the day
you pay the price
we'll hunt you down
traitor
show yourself
we know it's you
behind the curtain
pretending like you care
about everything
and everyone
when all
you think about is you
you will pay
for what you've done
you will pay
for what you've done
you will pay
for what you've done
show yourself
we know it's you
behind the curtain
show yourself
we know it's you
behind the curtain
pretending like you care
about everything
and everyone
but no matter
how far you may run
no matter where you try to hide
in the end will hunt you down
hunt you down
hunt you down
