destroy I create
I transform I annihilate
I'm the one who predicts your fate
Have no fear in my head
Have your money in my hands
I could rip the world apart
He's known as the man
Who runs it all
He's known as the man
Who brings the doom
He's known as the man
Who pulls the strings...
Behind
He's known as the man
Behind the curtain
Rising when you fall down
He's known as the man
Behind the curtain
Dominating all your lives
I can shut I can scream
I control your self-steem
I'm the one in who you trust your will
I pull the strings around the world
Your acts and words make me strong
Dominating what you can't stop
He's known as the man
With no remorse
He's known as the man
Who breaks the hope
He's known as the man
Who pulls the strings...
Behind
